Transform my Laravel settings into a modern, reactive interface with these essential enhancements:

1. Core user interface improvements:
   - Convert to Alpine.js for seamless reactivity without page refreshes
   - Implement responsive design with proper mobile optimization
   - Add subtle micro-interactions and animations for user actions
   - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance throughout

2. Form field modernization:
   - Replace standard selects with searchable, taggable select components
   - Implement drag-and-drop file uploads with preview thumbnails and progress indicators
   - Add modern date/time pickers with range selection and intuitive interface
   - Create smart address fields with autocomplete and validation
   - Convert radio/checkbox options to visually appealing card-based selections

3. Real-time data handling:
   - Add inline validation showing feedback as users type
   - Implement debounced auto-saving for form fields
   - Create optimistic UI updates with proper error state handling
   - Add non-intrusive success/error notifications
   - Enable direct inline editing for appropriate content

4. Backend performance and security:
   - Implement proper AJAX form submission with graceful error handling
   - Add comprehensive server-side validation with specific rules
   - Implement rate limiting for all form submissions
   - Create proper logging for analytics and debugging
   - Add appropriate caching strategies

5. Enhanced user experience:
   - Add loading states and skeleton screens during data operations
   - Implement form state preservation to prevent data loss
   - Add success animations upon form completion
   - Create contextual help tooltips for complex inputs
   - Enable keyboard navigation and shortcuts

Here's my current implementation:


Please provide a complete updated implementation focusing on the functionality most relevant to this specific module, including all necessary controller logic, Blade templates, Livewire components, JavaScript, CSS, and database migrations required to achieve these enhancements.

 consolidate redundant fields between users and staff tables to avoid repetition. I'll develop a SettingsController with proper validation, create Blade templates with Alpine.js for reactivity, implement JavaScript for real-time validation and auto-saving, and design responsive CSS with accessibility features. The implementation will include consolidated database models that eliminate duplicate fields across the three tables while maintaining proper relationships.





I'll consolidate the redundant fields between users and staff tables by implementing a proper database normalization strategy. First, I'll analyze the existing structure to identify duplicate fields like email, phone, and address that exist in both tables. Then, I'll create migrations to remove these redundant fields from the staff table while ensuring all data is properly transferred to the users table. I'll update the models with appropriate relationships and accessors to maintain functionality, modify controllers to work with the consolidated structure, and update the frontend templates to reflect these changes. Finally, I'll implement a comprehensive migration strategy with data preservation and rollback options.

Let me first explore the project structure to get a better understanding of the codebase.
